House Price Prediction
This project aims to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms using machine learning regression techniques.

Overview
The prediction model is built using several regression algorithms including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor. The performance of each model is evaluated using mean squared error (MSE) and cross-validation.

Getting Started
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Download the dataset files (train.csv and test.csv) and place them in the project directory.
Run the Jupyter Notebook house_price_prediction.ipynb to train the models and make predictions.
File Descriptions
house_price_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
train.csv: Dataset containing training examples.
test.csv: Dataset containing test examples.

pandas
numpy
Results
The best performing model based on cross-validation scores is Gradient Boosting Regressor, with a mean squared error of X.
